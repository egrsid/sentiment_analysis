# Sentiment Analysis Projects

This repository is dedicated to projects focused on sentiment classification using various data types such as text, video, and audio. The goal is to build machine learning models or neural networks that can accurately detect and classify emotions across different mediums. Below is an overview of the projects included and those that will be added soon.

## Projects

### 1. Sentiment Classification from Text
This project is focused on binary sentiment classification (positive or negative) based on text messages. The final model was developed after testing various machine learning algorithms, followed by hyperparameter optimization. The model is suitable for applications such as chatbot integration, enabling more emotionally intelligent interactions.

You can find the project in `text_recognition` folder.

Key files include:
- **model_parameters.pickle** – Optimized model parameters.
- **result_model_pipeline.pickle** – Final sentiment classification model.
- **text_recognition_code** – The research and training code.
- **test_model.py** – Command-line tool for testing the model on custom text input.

### 2. Sentiment Classification from Video (Coming Soon)
This project will focus on classifying sentiment based on facial expressions and visual cues in video recordings. Using computer vision techniques and deep learning models, the goal will be to develop a model that can detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, or anger from visual data.

### 3. Sentiment Classification from Audio (Coming Soon)
This project will aim to classify sentiment by analyzing audio recordings. The model will detect emotions based on vocal tone, pitch, and speech patterns, and could be applied in scenarios such as virtual assistants or call center analysis.
